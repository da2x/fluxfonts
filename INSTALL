* systemd-devel

Debian/Ubuntu:
* systemd-dev

Building on POSIX-like operating systems

1. make


Installing on POSIX-like operating systems

1. make install [install-daemon] [--prefix=/usr/local]

Linux installs a systemd service file for running the daemon with
`install-daemon` and macOS installs a launchd service file. FreeBSD
will need to configure a service or cron to run the daemon on boot.


Building on Windows

1. nmake -f Makefile.nmake Release\fluxfonts.exe
2. nmake -f Makefile.nmake Release\fluxfonts_installer.exe


Installing on Windows

1. Run Release\fluxfonts_installer.exe


Notes for package distributors

The program service does not need to run as the root user. Create the
required directories as part of the installation package, and the
fluxfontd daemon should only require read permissions for those
directories. This is the preferred way to run fluxfontd.
