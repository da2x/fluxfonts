Fluxfonts â€“ a continual font generator for increased privacy
https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/fluxfonts.html

See `COPYING` for the copyright notices and license terms of this
project. See `AUTHORS` for a complete list of project contributors.

New fonts are generated by the daemon every 2 to 40 minutes. Fonts
are generated at random times in this time window. However, they
are generated more often when not running on battery power (Linux
only).

See `INSTALL` for installation instructions.

The program is test compiled on FreeBSD, OS X, Ubuntu- and Debian
GNU/Linux, Fedora Linux, and Windows 10 and 11.

See `CONTRIBUTING` for guidelines on and acceptance criteria for
contributing back to the project.
